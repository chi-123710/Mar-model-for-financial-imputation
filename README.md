## all implement procedure
##You can install the released version of tensorTS
##install.packages("tensorTS")
##library(tensorTS)
##use Dataset.py to produce the data with/without missing value
##use test_csv_dimension to checkfor the dimensions
##main.R--the most important function,to transfer the data to R,and to estimate the mar model.
##MAR_proj_method is for LSE initialization
##MAR_lse_method is for LSE method of matrix autoregressive model
##MAR_plot is for time series plot and acf plot
##MAR_prediction is for prediction(based on the coefficient matrix)
##Test_producer.py is to create the dataset we need
##I also attach the test dataset.You can change it.
